## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

As part of my Full Stack Development Internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I have successfully completed Task-1: API Integration. The objective of this task was to develop a responsive web application that fetches and displays data dynamically from a public API. For this task, I developed a Weather Application using React that retrieves real-time weather information for any city entered by the user.

The application uses the OpenWeatherMap public API to fetch live weather data such as temperature, weather condition, and city name. React was chosen as the frontend framework because of its component-based architecture, efficient state management, and dynamic rendering capabilities. The project was initialized using Vite to ensure fast development and optimized performance.

The user interface of the application is clean, responsive, and centered on the screen using modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox. Users can enter the name of any city, and upon clicking the “Get Weather” button, the application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API. The response is processed and displayed dynamically on the screen without reloading the page. Error handling has also been implemented to display appropriate messages when an invalid city name is entered or when the API request fails.

Environment variables were used to securely store the API key, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed in the source code or GitHub repository. The project structure follows best practices, separating logic, styling, and configuration for better readability and maintainability.

This task helped me gain hands-on experience with API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, React hooks such as useState, environment variable management, and responsive UI design. Overall, the successful completion of this task demonstrates my understanding of frontend development concepts and real-world API usage in modern web applications.
